# Image-Classifier-Model
Deep Learning model to recognize different species of flowers.

  
  In this project, I have implemented an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images. First I have trained the model to classify new images using Jupyter notebook and then converted it into a Python application that will run from the command line in a system.
