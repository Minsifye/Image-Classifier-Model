## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, you will implement an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images. You will then use the trained model to classify new images. First you will develop your code in a Jupyter notebook, then convert it into a Python application that you will run from the command line of your system.

1. IMPLEMENTING GRADIENT DESCENT: Implement gradient descent to train deep learning networks.
2. TRAINING NEURAL NETWORKS: Learn about techniques for how to improve training of a neural network, such as: early stopping, regularization, and dropout.
3. KERAS: Learn how to use Keras for building deep learning models 
4. DEEP LEARNING WITH PYTORCH: Learn how to use PyTorch for building deep learning models
